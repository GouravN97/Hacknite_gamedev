## 🧠 Game Overview

Fractured Echoes is an immersive narrative-driven adventure game set across two parallel timelines: the broken present and the cherished past. At its heart, it's a story about loss, resistance, and reclaiming what once was. The game follows the journey of a young protagonist who, after losing everything to an oppressive regime, is driven by the kidnapping of his sister to uncover the truth, dismantle a corrupt system, and restore the peace of the past.
## 🌍 Thematic Core: Fractured Echoes
The entire game revolves around the theme of "Two Worlds":

The Present World: A dark, controlled dystopia where freedom is lost, buildings are hollow, and the city is haunted by government control.

The Past World (Memory): A bright, nostalgic space that reflects happier times, precious memories, and emotional warmth. It is a sanctuary of the protagonist’s mind.

The two worlds interact and influence each other, forming the foundation of all puzzles, exploration, and story progression


## 📜 Story
Once, life was beautiful.

The world was vibrant, filled with light, color, laughter, and the quiet kind of peace that makes you forget to be afraid. The main character and his sister lived in a city that felt like home in every way. The streets were alive, the skyline was warm, and every corner held a memory worth cherishing. The bond between them wasn’t just familial—it was their anchor, a constant in a world that felt safe and infinite.

But peace, like glass, is fragile.

One day, everything changed. Without warning, a catastrophic event tore through their home. Buildings crumbled. Hope vanished. In the ashes of the old world, a brutal, authoritarian regime rose to power. The city was transformed into a cold, lifeless husk of what it once was—ruled by fear, silence, and surveillance. The streets were no longer for walking. They were for watching. And no one dared to speak out. Not anymore.

The protagonist, once so full of life, grew numb. Like so many others, he accepted the darkness. He survived, not lived—drifting through the remnants of a broken society, carrying ghosts in his heart and the weight of a world that no longer cared.

Until she was taken.

His sister—bright, inquisitive, and a spark in the shadow—stumbled onto a secret. A truth so dangerous, so deeply buried, that the government would stop at nothing to silence it. And so they did the only thing they knew: they abducted her. Erased her. Tried to make her disappear, just like they did with everything that didn’t fit their vision of control.

But this time, they went too far.

Her disappearance shattered the apathy that held the protagonist in place. What was once silent compliance ignited into rage, purpose, and rebellion. This wasn’t just about her anymore. It was about everything they lost. Everything that was stolen. He wouldn’t just get her back—he’d tear the entire system down if he had to.

But to fight the present, he’d have to understand the past.

Now, he dives between two worlds: the harsh reality of the present, and the fading, fragmented memories of the past. In the present, he searches through the wreckage—buildings, streets, and ruins—collecting strange objects that may hold clues to the truth. But the clues make no sense on their own. To understand them, he must return to the memories—relive moments once forgotten, talk to people long gone, and walk again in the warmth of the world that was.

Each memory holds a key. Each clue brings him closer—not just to his sister, but to the truth behind everything that happened.

And when all the pieces fall into place, the world will remember what it tried so hard to forget.

Because memories don’t fade.
Not when someone is willing to fight for them.


## 🧩 Gameplay Loop
The game centers around a dual-world exploration system, where the protagonist moves between the decaying present and the beautiful, unspoiled past. Players will solve environmental puzzles, uncover memories, and gradually piece together the truth that will ultimately lead to the overthrow of the oppressive regime.

🔹 1. Exploration (Present)
Navigate a dystopian, decaying city filled with ruined buildings, abandoned streets, and a sense of loss.

Buildings, once alive with life, are now hollow, their walls shattered, interiors destroyed by time and neglect.

Enter the ruins of these buildings and discover clues—objects from the past that may seem insignificant but are deeply connected to long-lost memories.

Each clue triggers a pop-up message, explaining what it is and what it represents in the grander scheme, offering insight into its connection to the past.

The player’s goal is to piece together these clues to reveal the story, uncovering the regime’s control and the secret that lies behind the sister's abduction.

🔹 2. Memory Dive (Past)
When you find a clue in the present, dive into the past—the world before the fall, before everything was ruined.

The contrast is striking: the once-beautiful, vibrant buildings are now restored to their former glory, filled with life and beauty—both the streets and the interiors.

The transition between the present and the past is seamless, offering a consistent experience that doesn’t break the immersion.

Inside buildings, the perspective switches to a top-down view, allowing the player to move freely in all directions (up, down, left, and right).

Solve puzzles in the past that unlock deeper truths about the clues and the city's history, revealing emotional connections and the significance of the lost world.

The interiors are lush with detail, providing an immersive look at a time when the city was full of hope, in stark contrast to the broken present.

🔹 3. Progression
Every clue solved weakens the regime’s power and gets the protagonist closer to the ultimate goal:

Overthrowing the government

Rescuing the sister

Restoring the beauty and truth of the past

The transition between the present and the past remains consistent, allowing for a smooth gameplay experience while maintaining immersion in both worlds.

As players collect more clues, the story and world evolve, and the protagonist slowly pieces together the puzzle of what really happened and how to free the city from its suffocating control.

Over time:

The present becomes less uncertain.

The past becomes more powerful.

The player's actions begin to push back against the dystopia.

This constant shift between timelines creates a rhythm of discovery, reflection, and revolution—two worlds working together to rewrite fate.
